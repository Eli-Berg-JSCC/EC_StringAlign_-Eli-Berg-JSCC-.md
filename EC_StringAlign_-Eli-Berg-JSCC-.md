Lessons Learned:
In the extra credit string alignment assignment, I learned to improve my coding skills by practicing. 
This assignment has provided me with more experience in creating code and using more vocabulary present within C++. 
In my code, I was able to use most of the things we have been improving on this semester and some code that I was not familiar with. 
For example, I used a bool variable to only allow numerical inputs in the console to avoid errors when entering width values. 
The major factor in my learning was through trial and error. By trying new ideas, only to fail and try again, or to learn from my mistakes.

The only source guide I used was the Problem Solving in C++ 19th edition.
